PlayerAnalyzerTests Class Documentation

The PlayerAnalyzerTests class serves as a comprehensive suite of unit tests designed to thoroughly evaluate the functionality and accuracy of the PlayerAnalyzer class within the BLL (Business Logic Layer). These tests focus on the CalculateScore method, which calculates scores based on specific player attributes. By running these tests, developers can gain confidence in the correctness and reliability of the PlayerAnalyzer class, ensuring that it performs as intended in a variety of player scenarios.

The test class comprises multiple test methods, each targeting a specific use case. The first few test methods examine the calculation of scores for individual players. These tests validate the correct handling of different player attributes, such as age, experience, and skills. By providing specific player data and verifying the generated scores against expected values, these tests ensure that the CalculateScore method produces accurate results for single players.

Another test method evaluates the computation of scores for multiple players. This test simulates a scenario where multiple players with diverse attributes are analyzed collectively. The test method calculates the expected sum of scores by iterating through each player, considering their age, experience, and skills. The computed sum is then compared against the result obtained from the CalculateScore method, guaranteeing that the method accurately calculates the combined score of multiple players.

To account for potential edge cases and exceptional situations, the test class includes additional methods. One such test method verifies that an exception is thrown when attempting to calculate the score for a player with null skills. This ensures that the CalculateScore method appropriately handles null values and raises the expected exception. Another test method handles an empty player array, validating that the CalculateScore method returns a score of zero when there are no players to analyze.

StudentConverterTests Class Documentation

The StudentConverterTests class contains a set of unit tests that evaluate the functionality of the StudentConverter class within the BLL. These tests focus on the ConvertStudents method, responsible for converting a list of students into a specific format. By running these tests, developers can ensure the accuracy and correctness of the conversion logic implemented in the StudentConverter class.

The test class includes several test methods, each targeting different conversion scenarios. These tests validate the correct assignment of properties such as Exceptional, HonorRoll, Passed, and Failed based on the students' grades and other attributes.

To handle exceptional cases, the test class includes test methods to verify the behavior of the ConvertStudents method when an empty student array or null input is provided. These tests ensure that the method handles these scenarios appropriately, returning empty results or throwing the expected exceptions.

Running Tests Locally:

To run these tests locally, ensure that the BLL project, including the PlayerAnalyzer, StudentConverter, and Student classes, is properly set up in your project. Make sure to include the required dependencies, such as the testing framework (e.g., Xunit). Configure the test project to reference the BLL project and any other necessary dependencies.

Once the setup is complete, you can execute the tests by building the solution and running the test project. The testing framework will execute each test method and provide detailed feedback on the pass/fail status of each test. By running these tests, you can verify the accuracy and reliability of the PlayerAnalyzer and StudentConverter classes, ensuring that they perform as expected in various scenarios and contributing to the overall quality of your application.
