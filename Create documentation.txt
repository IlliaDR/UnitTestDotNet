PlayerAnalyzerTests Class Documentation

The PlayerAnalyzerTests class serves as a comprehensive suite of unit tests designed to thoroughly evaluate the functionality and accuracy of the PlayerAnalyzer class. These tests focus on the CalculateScore method, which is responsible for computing scores based on specific player attributes. By running these tests, developers can gain confidence in the correctness and reliability of the PlayerAnalyzer class, ensuring that it performs as intended in a variety of scenarios.

The test class comprises multiple test methods, each targeting a specific use case. The first few test methods examine the calculation of scores for individual players. These tests validate the correct handling of different player attributes, such as age, experience, and skills. By providing specific player data and verifying the generated scores against expected values, these tests ensure that the CalculateScore method produces accurate results for single players.

Another test method evaluates the computation of scores for multiple players. This test simulates a scenario where multiple players with diverse attributes are analyzed collectively. The test method calculates the expected score sum by iterating through each player, considering their age, experience, and skills. The computed sum is then compared against the result obtained from the CalculateScore method, guaranteeing that the method accurately calculates the combined score of multiple players.

To account for potential edge cases and exceptional situations, the test class includes additional methods. One such test method verifies that an exception is thrown when attempting to calculate the score for a player with null skills. This ensures that the CalculateScore method appropriately handles null values and raises the expected exception. Another test method handles an empty player array, validating that the CalculateScore method returns a score of zero when there are no players to analyze.

To execute these tests locally using BLL (Business Logic Layer), developers should set up the necessary project dependencies and configurations. By following the guidelines mentioned earlier, developers can ensure the accurate assessment of player scores and maintain the overall quality and reliability of the PlayerAnalyzer class.

StudentConverterTests Class Documentation

The StudentConverterTests class contains a set of unit tests that evaluate the functionality of the StudentConverter class within the BLL (Business Logic Layer). These tests focus on the ConvertStudents method, which is responsible for converting a list of students into a specific format. By running these tests, developers can ensure the accuracy and correctness of the conversion logic implemented in the StudentConverter class.

The test class includes several test methods, each targeting different conversion scenarios. The first test method validates the conversion of a list of students into a custom format. It verifies that the ConvertStudents method returns a list of converted students and that the converted students have the expected properties, such as Exceptional, HonorRoll, and Passed. The test ensures that the conversion process accurately assigns these properties based on the students' grades and other attributes.

Another test method focuses on a specific scenario where a student's age is below 21, and their grade is above 90. This test asserts that the ConvertStudents method correctly identifies such exceptional students and assigns the Exceptional property accordingly. By checking the properties of the converted student, including their name, age, grade, and Exceptional flag, this test ensures that exceptional students are accurately identified during the conversion process.

Similarly, there is a test method that examines the conversion of students whose grades fall between 71 and 90. This test ensures that the ConvertStudents method correctly identifies and marks these students as "passed" based on their grade. It validates that the Passed property is set correctly for the converted student within the specified grade range.

Additionally, there is a test method that handles students with grades of 70 or less. This test verifies that the ConvertStudents method accurately identifies and flags these students as "failed." It ensures that the Failed property is set correctly for the converted student with a grade below or equal to 70.

To handle exceptional cases, the test class includes a test method to verify the behavior of the ConvertStudents method when an empty student array is provided. This test asserts that the method correctly returns an empty array as the result of the conversion, ensuring that the logic handles empty input appropriately.

Finally, a test method checks the behavior of the ConvertStudents method when a null input is provided. This test verifies that the method throws an ArgumentNullException as expected when encountering a null input parameter.

To run these tests locally, ensure that the BLL project, including the StudentConverter and Student classes, is properly set up in your project. Make sure to include the required dependencies, such as the testing framework (e.g., Xunit). Configure the test project to reference the BLL project and any other necessary dependencies.

Once the setup is complete, you can execute the tests by building the solution and running the test project. The testing framework will execute each test method and provide detailed feedback on the pass/fail status of each test. By running these tests, you can verify the accuracy and reliability of the StudentConverter class, ensuring that it correctly converts students into the desired format as defined by the provided scenarios.
